# GoogleITcertification
Repository created from following course 3 of the certification

This certification was so I could fill in the practical aspects I might have missed due to taking only a CS minor and working on independent projects.
This certification gave me more foundational to build off of including: 
* git hub usage
* creating my own modules to build up larger tasks (which can then be automated)
* configuration using cloud services 
* bash scripting and pipelining 
* best practices and approaches with each of these
