# GoogleITcertification
Repository created from following course 3 of the certification

This certification was to fill-in the practical aspects I might have missed due to taking only a CS minor and working on independent projects during my co-ops.
This certification gave me more foundational to build off of including: 
* git hub usage
* creating my own modules to build up larger tasks (which can then be automated)
* configuration using cloud services 
* bash scripting and pipelining 
* best practices and approaches with each of these

Filling in these gaps will allow my contributions in the workplace to be more robust. They will merge better with the work of others, which is key to ensuring the continued adoption of my work in the future.
